Rather, they generate pseudorandom numbers using what's known as a PRNG (pseudorandom number generator). These numbers are actually determined deterministically _but_ they have many statistical properties of randomly generated numbers that are suitable for our purposes. In fact, the sequence of numbers generated by any PRNG is uniquely determined by an initial value that we can set, known as the _seed_, for obvious reasons.\n",

In the next chapter, we'll introduce you to a figure known as the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), which makes it far easier to answer questions such as this, and also has many other benefits."

The base rate of 99% true positive may lead one to think that most positive tests will be of people who have X, however the vast majority of the overall population don't have X, which means that there will be more that test positive incorrectly than one would otherwise expect. You may also have noticed that mistaking $P(+ve|disease)$ for $P(disease|+ve)$ is an example of Bernoulli's fallacy!"
