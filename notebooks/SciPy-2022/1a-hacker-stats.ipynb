For example, if you wanted to know the probability of seeing 4 or more heads, you'd have to squint, approximate the height of several boxes, and add up those values. In the next chapter, we'll introduce you to a figure known as the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), which makes it far easier to answer questions such as this, and also has many other benefits."

The base rate of 99% true positive may lead one to think that most positive tests will be of people who have X, however the vast majority of the overall population don't have X, which means that there will be more that test positive incorrectly than one would otherwise expect. You may also have noticed that mistaking $P(+ve|disease)$ for $P(disease|+ve)$ is an example of Bernoulli's fallacy!"
