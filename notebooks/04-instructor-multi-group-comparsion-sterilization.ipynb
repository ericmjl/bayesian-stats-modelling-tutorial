    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to give you more practice with PyMC3 syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is intentionally designed to provide more guidance w.r.t. model definition, i.e. which parameters to use, such that the focus is more on PyMC3 syntax rather than the mechanics of model definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already feeling comfortable with PyMC3 syntax, and would like to instead move on to practice with model definition, then feel free to move onto notebook 5 instead, where you can play with the Darwin's Finches dataset. That notebook is intentionally designed with much more freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be experimentally analyzing the effectiveness of six different phone sterilization methods against two control methods. This research was conducted at MIT's Division of Comparative Medicine, and was published this year in the Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science. If you're interested, you can read the paper [here][jaalas].\n",
    "\n",
    "[jaalas]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29402348\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, the experiments were setup as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-sterilization, three sites on the phone were swabbed and the number of colony forming units (CFUs) was determined by letting the swabbed bacteria grow on an agar plate.\n",
    "1. Post-sterilization, the same three sites were swabbed and the number of CFUs was counted.\n",
    "1. Sterilization efficacy was determined by taking the ratio of the difference of CFUs pre- and post-sterilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, we used the following formula to compute the percentage reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_{method} = \\frac{{count}_{pre} - {count}_{post}}{{count}_{pre}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In retrospect, a better definition would have been:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\frac{{count}_{pre} - {count}_{post}}{{count}_{pre}}$$\n",
    "$$\\delta_{method} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    0 & \\text{if} & x\\lt0, \\\\\n",
    "    1 & \\text{if} & x\\gt1, \\\\\n",
    "    x & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, due to experimental variation, there are more colonies post-sterilization than pre-sterilization. This may occur particularly when the number of colonies counted on a plate is low (e.g. countable on our fingers). Thus, clipping the values helps us avoid negative percentage reductions, which one might consider to be be an \"absurd\" scenario to be in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this notebook came from [Evaluation of 6 Methods for Aerobic Bacterial Sanitization of Smartphones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29402348)."
