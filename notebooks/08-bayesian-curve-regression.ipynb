    "You've taken radioactive decay measurements of an unknown element in a secure facility. The measurements are noisy, though, and potentially have some bias. In the face of this, we would like to be able to characterize the decay constant of this unknown material, potentially leading to an identification of the material.\n",

In this case, we've used the exponential decay curve as the link function, but if you were doing a linear regression model, all you would have to do is to change the link function for the $y=mx+c$ \"straight curve\", and do another curve fit with the appropriate priors for $m$ and $c$.\n",
