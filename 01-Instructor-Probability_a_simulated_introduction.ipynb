    "> To the pioneers such as Bernoulli, Bayes and Laplace, a probability represented a _degree-of-belief_ or plausibility; how much they thought that something was true, based on the evidence at hand. To the 19th century scholars, however, this seemed too vague and subjective an idea to be the basis of a rigorous mathematical theory. So they redefined probability as the _long-run relative frequency_ with which an event occurred, given (infinitely) many repeated (experimental) trials. Since frequencies can be measured, probability was now seen as an objective tool for dealing with _random_ phenomena.\n",

    "**Note:** you may have noticed that the _binomial distribution_ can take on only  a finite number of values, whereas the _uniform distribution_ above can take on any number between $0$ and $1$. These are different enough cases to warrant special mention of this & two different names: the former is called a _probability mass function_ (PMF) and the latter a _probability distribution function_ (PDF). Time permitting, we may discuss some of the subtleties here. If not, all good texts will cover this. I like (Sivia & Skilling, 2006), among many others.\n"

    "In his great book on information theory, statistical inference, and machine learning, David MacKay described a town called Poissonville where the buses have a very erratic schedule. If you stand at a bus stop in Poissonville, the amount of time you have to wait for a bus is completely independent of when the previous bus arrived. In other words, you would watch a bus drive off and another one will arrive almost instantly, or you could be waiting for hours.\n",

The Poisson distribution has one parameter, the average number of arrivals in a given length of time. So, to match the story, we could consider the number of hits on a website in an hour with an average of six hits per hour. This is Poisson distributed."

    "> You just heard that the Poisson distribution is a limit of the Binomial distribution for rare events. This makes sense if you think about the stories. Say we do a Bernoulli trial every minute for an hour, each with a success probability of 0.1. We would do 60 trials, and the number of successes is Binomially distributed, and we would expect to get about 6 successes. This is just like the Poisson story we discussed in the video, where we get on average 6 hits on a website per hour. So, the Poisson distribution with arrival rate equal to np approximates a Binomial distribution for n Bernoulli trials with probability p of success (with n large and p small). Importantly, the Poisson distribution is often simpler to work with because it has only one parameter instead of two for the Binomial distribution."

The ECDF of the number of no-hitters in a season is shown to the right. Which probability distribution would be appropriate to describe the number of no-hitters we would expect in a given season?"

When a player takes a shot is a largely stochastic process, being influenced by the myriad ebbs and flows of a basketball game. Some players shoot more than others, though, so there is a well-defined rate of shooting. Let's consider LeBron James's field goal attempts for the 2017-2018 NBA season. First, the data."

    "> Just as there are many named discrete distribution, there are many named continuous distributions as well. For example, let's take a another trip to Poissonville and stand at a bus stop. We know that the number of buses that will arrive per hour are Poisson distributed. But the amount of time between arrivals of buses are Exponentially distributed.\n",
    "The Exponential distribution has this story: the waiting time between arrivals of a Poisson process are exponentially distributed. It has a single parameter, the mean waiting time. This distribution is not peaked, as we can see from its PDF.\n",
    "As an example, we can look at the time between all incidents involving nuclear power since 1974. We might expect incidents to be well-modeled by a Poisson process, ie, the timing of one incident is independent of all others. So, the time between incidents should be Exponentially distributed.\n",
    "We can compute and plot the CDF we would expect based on the mean time between incidents and overlay that with the ECDF from the real data. We take our usual approach where we draw many samples out of the Exponential distribution, using the mean inter-incident time as the parameter. We make the plot and label the axes.\n",
    "We see that it is close to being Exponentially distributed, indicating the nuclear incidents can indeed be modeled as a Poisson process.\n",
