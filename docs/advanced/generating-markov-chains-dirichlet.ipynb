    "You can think of it as stick-breaking, basically. We take a stick of unit length 1, and break it in two according to a draw from a Beta distribution. We record the length of the left part of the stick, and then break the right stick into two according to a draw from a Beta distribution. We then record the new length of the left side and break the right one again and again, _ad infinitum_ or until we have reached a predefined (but finite) number of breaks. The vector of recorded lengths becomes a \"weighting\" vector. One thing to keep in mind: this weighting vector doesn't necessarily sum to 1, so in order to use the weighting vector in a transition matrix, we do have to normalize it to sum to 1, or we append the remainder of the stick to the end to get it to sum to 1.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a bit of a whirlwind tour of a notebook, in that there were many concepts and ideas tied together into one \"project\". \n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to HMMs, it's super important to have a proper mental model of each of its components. In the case of _expressing_ the idea that we have a restricted number of states, we may _engineer_ this into the model by taking advantage of column-wise heaviness in a restricted subset of states. This is mathematically most naturally incorporated by composint together row-wise Dirichlet-distributed probability arrays. We can also mathematically _engineer_ consistency in states by taking advantage of high Beta-distributed values. Compose the two together, and we get a transition matrix that favours entry into a small number of states with stability in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that lesson, we saw the power of composable programs using JAX. `vmap`, `jit`, `lax.scan`, and more from the JAX toolkit gives us the ability to write performant programs that sort of \"just make sense\", once you know what their idioms are. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `vmap` is a vanilla for-loop, processing an elementary function over an axis of an array.\n",
    "- `lax.scan` is a carry-over for-loop, processing the result of a previous iteration, with accumulation of history as well.\n",
    "- `jit` gives you just-in-time compilation of a function.\n",
    "- `grad` gives you gradients of any arbitrary function written in a JAX-compatible, pure functional fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, getting used to the `lax.scan` idioms has been a literal door-opener. We can now write really performant loops that use results from previous iterations, such as a gradient descent training loop or an MCMC sampler. Using `lax.scan`, we wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Markov chain state generator\n",
    "- A generator of Dirichlet-distributed weights from i.i.d. Beta distribution draws\n",
    "- A reverse generator/estimator of Beta distribution draws from Dirichlet-distributed weights (with some inaccuracies of course, due to a lack of information).\n",
    "- A fully-compiled gradient descent training loop that ran extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "And using `vmap`, we were able to do all sorts of vanilla loops, but the one I want to highlight is our ability to `vmap` the compiled training loop across multiple transition matrices. The fact that this _actually_ works never has left me in awe. Props to the JAX team here! Opens the door to `vmap`-ing training loops across random starting points (i.e. a split PRNGKey, much like what we did in the HMM state generator).\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off is that we don't get nice progress bars, of course, which require that we break out of the compiled loop to show the current state. But the compilation speedups provided the opportunity to build our compiled tensor program end-to-end. We could verify first that things ran correctly on a moderately-sized number of iterations, before finally estimating how long we would need to go until convergence and letting the program run on its own. I'm sure this little change isn't too hard to adapt to, but will give you access to a whole new world of differential tensor programming that is just _cool_!"
