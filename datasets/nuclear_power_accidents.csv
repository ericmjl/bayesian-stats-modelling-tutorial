On 18 June 1988, while the pressurized water reactor was operating, a sudden leak
occurred in a short, unisolable section of emergency core cooling system (ECCS) piping. The leak
rate was in the order of 1,300 liters per hour. The source of leakage was a crack – 9 cm long on the
inside surface of the pipe and 4.5 cm long on the outside surface – extending through the wall of
the piping. The risk of a pipe rupture in the emergency core cooling system is considerable if the
emergency safety injection system is activated as large quantities of cooling water are injected in
case of a loss of coolant accident in an already degraded safety situation.",0
2/9/1991,Japan,,,,A,"Mihama-2 (Japan) (see 9.2.2.3)
A steam generator tube rupture occurred at Mihama-2 pressurized water reactor. This was
the first such incident in Japan where the emergency core cooling system was actuated. The utility
investigated the rupture and found that it was a complete circumferential tube failure. The utility
found that the failure due to high cycle fatigue caused by vibration. By design, all tubes in specific
locations in the steam generator are supposed to be supported by anti-vibration bars. However, the
subject tube was found not to be supported appropriately because of a reported ""incorrect
insertion"" of the adjacent anti-vibration bars.",0
4/3/1991,USA,,,,NA,"3 April 1991 Shearon Harris (USA) (see 9.2.1.1)
On 3 April 1991 workers at the Shearon Harris pressurized water reactor in New Hill,
North Carolina discovered damaged piping and valves within the alternate minimum flow system
provided for the pumps in the emergency core cooling system. The piping and valve damage was
serious, had an accident occurred the water needed to cool the reactor core would have instead
poured out onto the floor through the ends of broken components. The NRC calculated the severe
core damage risk from this event to be 6 x 10-3 or 0.6% per reactor year. The event was not rated
on the IAEA INES scale.",0
6/28/1992,Sweden,,2,,WE,"Barseback-2 (Sweden) (see 9.2.7.1)
A leaking pilot valve in the boiling water reactor in Barseback initiated automatically
safety functions like reactor scram, high-pressure safety injection, core spray and containment
spray systems. The steam jet from an open safety valve was impinging on thermally insulated
equipment. Insulating material was washed into the suppression pool and affected the emergency
core cooling system, which is essential for heat removal in case of a leak the reactor coolant.
Similar incidents occurred in several countries and the problem turned out to apply to many, if not
most, of the light water reactors in the world",0
5/12/1988,France,,2,,WE,"The Civaux-1 pressurized water reactor was shut down for five days, when, during startup
tests, a 25 cm diameter pipe of the main residual heat removal system cracked open and a large
leak (30,000 liters per hour) occurred in the primary cooling circuit. The reactor core needs to be
cooled permanently, even when it is shut down, in order to evacuate the significant amount of
residual heat of the fuel. It took nine hours to isolate the leak and reach a stable situation. An
18 cm long crack on a weld was identified and 300 m3 of primary coolant had leaked into the
reactor building. The unit had been operating for only six months at 50% power level maximum
prior to the event. The operator, EDF, suggested rating this event at level 1 on the INES scale, but
the safety authorities decided on level 2.",0
3/18/2001,Tawian,,,,A,"The pressurized water reactor was affected by a total loss of external and internal power
supply. Power supply is crucial to evacuate residual heat from the reactor core. The plant is
situated near the sea. Salt deposit on insulators due to foggy weather caused instability of the high
voltage grid. During a switch to the grid a short circuit in a power switch of the emergency power
line occurred and caused a cable fire. A breaker and switchgear was totally destroyed by the fire
and the diesel generators could not be started up manually because of heavy smoke. It took about
two hours to restore power supply.",0
8/12/2001,Germany,,2,,WE,"Philippsburg (Germany) (see 9.2.3.1)
A deviation from the specified boron concentration – a neutron absorber needed to slow
down or stop the nuclear reaction – in several flooding storage tanks during the restart of the plant
was reported to the authorities. In addition, the liquid level had not reached the required value
fixed in the operational instructions for the start-up and was only implemented with a delay. The
emergency core cooling system will only work effectively if it is operated according to the design
basis conditions. Subsequent investigations revealed that significant deviations from start-up
requirements and violations from related instructions seemed to be common probably for several
years and took place in other German nuclear plants.",0

A hydrogen explosion caused a high degree of damage to the spray system piping of the

pressure vessel head and the flange area upon plant shutdown. Some parts of the 5.6 mm diameter
pipes were ruptured. An approximately 2.7 m long piping section had burst and was completely
destroyed. Some sections of the piping were missing. Prior to this event the possibility of severe
explosions caused by radiolysis gas during normal operation was nearly excluded",0
5/1/2005,Bulgaria,,2,,EE,"Kozloduy-5 (Bulgaria) (see 9.2.3.2)
In the process of power reduction at the Russian designed pressurized water reactor
(WWER) the operators identified that three control rod assemblies remained in the upper end
position. The follow-up movement tests of the remaining control rod assemblies identified that 22
out of 61 could not be moved with the driving mechanisms. The exact number of control rod
assemblies unable to scram (to drop due to the gravity only) remains unknown but it is thought to
be between 22 and 55. The WWER-1000 scram system is designed to put the reactor in safe
shutdown if one control rod assembly at the most is jammed in the upper position. The operator
had originally rated the incident INES level 0, but the safety authorities finally admitted to a level
2 rating.",0
6/25/2006,Sweden,,,,WE,"Forsmark, Sweden (see 9.2.6.2)
A short circuit in an outdoor switching station of the grid nearby the boiling water reactors
caused the emergency shutdown (scram) of unit 1 and, in a complex scenario, led to a number of
subsequent failures at the plant. Due to a design error, the disconnection of the plant from the grid
and the switch to house load operation – where the power plant uses its own power to operate
essential auxiliaries – did not function as planned. An inappropriate converter adjustment led to
the failure of the attempt to connect safety related equipment to the emergency power supply. The
start up of two of the four emergency diesel generators was aborted, which lead to a partial
blackout even in the main control room. Due to the lack of information about the important
parameters for a period of time the exact state of the plant and the consequences of potential
actions to perform were unclear. The shift team decided nevertheless to try to reconnect the plant
to the grid, which was performed successfully.",0
